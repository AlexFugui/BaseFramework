    <string name="introduction_tip">BaseFramework is a summary of my previous programming and development. The purpose is to complete the project development in the fastest way. Therefore, some commonly used small tools, such as simple toast and simple log, are placed in the basic class. You only need to inherit the BaseActivity and BaseFragment from your project. \n In addition, BaseActivity also provides immersive adaptation. You can check Demo\'s source code to learn more. \nThis is a Demo based on BaseActivity.</string>
